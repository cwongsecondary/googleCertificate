Write a Python script that uploads all the feedback stored in this folder to the company's website, without having to turn it into a dictionary one by one.

The script should follow the structure:

 - List all .txt files under /data/feedback directory that contains the actual feedback to be displayed on the company's website.


        *** Hint: Use os.listdir() method for this, which returns a list of all files and directories in the
            specified path.


 - You should now have a list that contains all of the feedback files from the path /data/feedback. Traverse
    over each file and, from the contents of these text files, create a dictionary by keeping: title, name,
    date, and feedback as keys for the content value, respectively.


 - Now, you need to have a **dictionary** with keys and their respective values (content from feedback files).
    This will be uploaded through the Django REST API.


 - Use the Python **requests** module to post the dictionary to the company's website. Use the 'request.post()'
    method to make a POST request to http://<corpweb-external-IP>/feedback. Replace <corpweb-external-IP> with
    corpweb's external IP address.


 - Make sure an error message isn't returned. You can print the status_code and text of the response objects to
    check out what's going on. You can also use the response status_code '201' for created success status
    response code that indicates the request has succeeded.
